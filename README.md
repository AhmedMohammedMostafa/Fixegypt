## Project Overview
Fix Egypt is a citizen-driven platform designed to report, track, and manage infrastructure issues across Egypt. The application enables citizens to document problems like road damage, water issues, electrical failures, and other public infrastructure concerns through an intuitive mobile-friendly interface.

## Problem Statement and Solution

### Problem Statement
Egypt, like many developing countries, faces significant infrastructure challenges:
- Limited mechanisms for citizens to report infrastructure issues
- Lack of transparency in issue tracking and resolution
- Inefficient allocation of government resources for infrastructure maintenance
- No incentive system for citizen participation in public service improvement

### Solution
Fix Egypt addresses these challenges through:
- A user-friendly platform for citizens to report infrastructure issues with location, images, and detailed descriptions
- A transparent tracking system for reports from submission to resolution
- An interactive map displaying all reported issues with their current status
- A points-based reward system to incentivize citizen participation
- Administrative tools for authorities to manage, prioritize, and update issue status
