# AI Integration

FixEgypt uses AI capabilities for image analysis and urgency detection in city reports.

## Current Implementation
The [AIService](mdc:src/infrastructure/ai/AIService.js) provides two main functions:
1. **Image Analysis**: Classifies report images into categories (road damage, water issues, etc.)
2. **Urgency Detection**: Determines report urgency from descriptions and images

## Integration Requirements
AI services should be implemented with:
- [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/docs/gemini_api) or [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/docs) for production
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference) models as an alternative
- Configuration in [config.js](mdc:src/config.js) for API endpoints and keys

## Integration Points
- [CreateReportUseCase](mdc:src/application/use-cases/report/CreateReportUseCase.js): For new report analysis
- [ReportController](mdc:src/infrastructure/web/controllers/reportController.js): For image uploads

## Analysis Requirements
1. **Image Classification**:
   - Input: Report images
   - Output: Category classification with confidence score

2. **Urgency Detection**:
   - Input: Report description and images
   - Output: Urgency level (low, medium, high, critical) with confidence

3. **Real Implementation**:
   - No mocked responses in production
   - Proper error handling with fallbacks
   - Performance optimization for quick user feedback
