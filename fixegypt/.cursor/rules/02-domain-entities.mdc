# Domain Entities

Domain entities represent the core business objects in the FixEgypt system.

## User Entity
[User](mdc:src/domain/entities/User.js) represents citizens and admins in the system:
- Contains Egyptian National ID with validation
- Role-based access (citizen vs admin)
- Email verification status
- Methods for checking permissions

## Report Entity
[Report](mdc:src/domain/entities/Report.js) represents city infrastructure issues:
- Contains issue details, location, images, status tracking
- Includes AI analysis results
- Status workflow: pending → in-progress → resolved/rejected
- Urgency levels: low, medium, high, critical
- Maintains full status history with admin actions

## Domain Services
[AuthService](mdc:src/domain/services/AuthService.js) handles core authentication logic:
- Password hashing and comparison
- JWT token generation and verification
- Not dependent on external implementations

## Repository Interfaces
Define contracts for data operations:
- [UserRepository](mdc:src/domain/repositories/UserRepository.js)
- [ReportRepository](mdc:src/domain/repositories/ReportRepository.js)

These entities encapsulate business rules and validation logic, independent of how they're stored or presented.
